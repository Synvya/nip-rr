Reservation Protocol

This repository contains the protocol specification and YAML schemas for NIP-RP (Reservation Protocol).

This NIP defines a protocol to manage reservations via Nostr. The term "reservations" is used as a broad term and could be applied to restaurants, hotels, or any other business offering appointments. This NIP also defines a business transaction attestation event associated with a succesfully completed reservation so that customers can issue a **verified business review**.
